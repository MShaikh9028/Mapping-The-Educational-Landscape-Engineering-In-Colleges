Mapping The Educational Landscape: Engineering In Colleges
As part of a data analytics initiative, I conducted an in-depth study of engineering colleges across India to address the fragmented nature of educational data available to students, parents, and policymakers.

Key Objectives:

Analyzed the geographical distribution and density of engineering institutions across all Indian states.

Categorized and evaluated undergraduate and postgraduate course offerings, including specializations.

Assessed fee structures of colleges, distinguishing between government and private institutions.

Conducted a comparative study of infrastructure facilities such as labs, libraries, and hostels.

Utilized web scraping techniques (e.g., from Careers360) for data collection and built comprehensive datasets for analysis.

The outcome: Actionable insights that can aid stakeholders in making informed decisions, improving education policy-making, and fostering stronger industry-academic collaboration.

Tools & Techniques Used: Python, Pandas, Web Scraping, Data Visualization

This project not only honed my technical skills in data analysis but also emphasized the real-world impact of transforming raw data into meaningful insights for public benefit.
